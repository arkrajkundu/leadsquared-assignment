# Cat Image Fetcher

This is a **React + Vite** project that displays cat images fetched from the [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/). It demonstrates various loading mechanisms and user interactions for fetching and displaying data.

## Features

1. **Easy Mode**: Fetch cat images on button click and display them in a responsive grid layout.
2. **Medium Mode**: Implement pagination with "Previous" and "Next" buttons to navigate through the fetched images.
3. **Hard Mode**: Load the initial set of 10 images and allow users to load more images by clicking a "Load More" button.
